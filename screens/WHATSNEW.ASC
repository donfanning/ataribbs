What's new? :)

I just added the first bits of 
filemenu functionality, to allow
menus of files to be built. The most 
common uses of this would be for a 
bulletin menu (like this one.), or 
a gallery of ASCII or ATASCII images
or "break movies."

There is a menu editor, fmenue, which
you use to create and edit the menu
files which are read by 
filemenu_show(). 

To use, simply use the tool to create
the FMU file, and select the letters
or numbers you wish to use for the
individual entries. 

For the filename, you can provide
a full path to the file, complete with
a drive or directory specifier, if 
wanted, however, don't put an extension.
This will automatically be appended
based on the terminal type.

A pair of screen files (for ATASCII
and ASCII) should also be written
with the same filename, ending in 
either .ATA or .ASC (just like every
other screen file.) 

The resulting filemenu can then be
called from code e.g.

filemenu_show('D1:>BULLETIN>bulletin');

More to come soon, I have to do some
serious debugging of the 
terminal_send_screen() routines.
