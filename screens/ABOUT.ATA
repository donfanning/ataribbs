ABOUT BB65:››BB65 is a Bulletin Board system impl-›emented in CC65, a cross compiler›for 6502 based computers, including›the Atari 8-bit machines. BB65 star-›ted as a proof of concept impl-›ementation to see what all the›compiler, assembler, and linker›suite could accomplish.››BB65 is still being built, but›the end goal is to provide a modular›BBS system to interested Atari 8-bit›users, and to do so in a very ›no-nonsense manner. ››The code is publically available,›downloadable from GITHUB:››http://github.com/tschak909/ataribbs››and is available under the GNU Public›License, version 3 or later. ››I hope to be able to add enough func-›tionality into BB65, so that anyone›interested can use their Atari 8-bit›computer to build either menu-based›or room-based BBSes that can be ›accessible via MODEM or TELNET.››I will periodically add to Bulletin›B - What's New - to indicate new ›features, for interested users, ›Check back often!››                 -TSCHAK, YOUR SYSOP›››
